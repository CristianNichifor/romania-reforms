"""The gravitational accretion model — reference implementation of brief §2.

This is the specification in executable form. The TypeScript port in `web/src/model/` is
tested against it, so where the two disagree, this one is right by definition.

Determinism is not a nice-to-have here. Every collection is sorted before iteration and
every tie has an explicit, documented break. A set iteration order leaking into the output
would mean the same sliders produce different maps on different machines, which destroys
the only property that makes this tool arguable.

Two readings of the brief are worth stating, because both are judgement calls:

1. **Promoted seeds are drawn from the potential-absorber pool**, not from all 3,186 UATs.
   Brief §2 step 1 says "argmax over unpromoted UATs", but §4 says the ≥5,000 population
   set is "the floor of the X slider, so nothing outside it can ever be an absorber". The
   second is the binding constraint — the candidacy grid only exists for that pool — so
   promotion picks from it.

2. **A seed that is absorbed before its own turn does not form a region.** Absorbers are
   processed in tier order and mark their members claimed; if a county capital reaches a
   smaller town first, that town joins the capital's region rather than founding its own.
   This follows the brief's `if u.claimed: continue` literally.

    The gravitational rules answer "who can reach whom". This answers a different question:
    "is the result large enough to be worth creating". A unit of 4,000 people still needs a
    mayor, a secretary and a budget, so a scenario can otherwise leave a smaller map that
    has not actually fixed anything.

    **The partner is the nearest by road, not the smallest.** Choosing the smallest combined
    population — which is right in the orphan tier, where the candidates are tiny
    neighbours — is badly wrong applied to whole units: small units chain into whatever
    happens to be adjacent until something clears the target. In Tulcea that put Măcin into
    Babadag 60 km away at the other end of the county, and collapsed 19 sensible units into
    three. Distance is what everything else in this model uses, and it is what a resident
    would ask about first.

    A unit that has reached the target is never a partner. Satisfied units are finished, and
    a short neighbour with nowhere to go stays short and is reported rather than being poured
    into whatever large unit happens to be nearest.

    Units can end below the target legitimately: an isolated commune whose every neighbour
    is already large has nowhere to go. They are reported rather than forced.

    Harsova, 23,290 over 828 km2. Nothing before this point ever compared the two from
