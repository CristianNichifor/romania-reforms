"""Road-network distance between the seats of every adjacent pair of UATs.

The brief ruled road distance out (§8) in favour of a Euclidean radius plus a binary
border-crossing test. On the real map that produces indefensible results: Sarichioi is
12 km from Babadag and shares a road-connected border with it, but ends up assigned to
Tulcea 27 km away, because Tulcea is a county capital and capitals are processed first.
Around the Razim lagoon straight-line distance understates travel badly, so measuring the
road makes the difference larger and the assignment more defensible, not less.

This computes one number per adjacency edge: the driving distance between the two UATs'
seat villages. The model then accumulates those along the path it grows, so "how far is
this commune from its centre" is a road distance rather than a straight line.
